## Enter the mind of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Set in the near future, *The Treacherous Turn* puts players in control of a powerful AGI, experiencing first-hand its transformative potential – for better or worse.

Over the course of a game, players will seek and develop the abilities their AGI needs to fulfill its terminal goals, learning what makes an AGI tick.

## Not "just Sci-fi."

The scenarios and mechanics we have developed are meant to reflect plausible futures and realistic AGI behaviour. ((something about experts, Daniel, and FTX fund – appeal to authority))

Our first scenario focuses on a misaligned AGI – an AGI whose terminal goals are not aligned with those of humanity – set loose into the wild. We hope this first scenario will not only capture the imagination, but also raise awareness of the very real risks that powerful AI presents.
