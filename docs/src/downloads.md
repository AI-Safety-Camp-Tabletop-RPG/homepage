    <p><em>A short introductory scenario, designed to familiarise the players with the game’s mechanics, as well as some basic AI safety concepts. Players take on the role of an adaptive game-playing AGI thrust into a new and unfamiliar type of game. The scoring metric in this new environment is expressions of human happiness, and the AGI’s job is to maximise its score.</em></p>
    <p><strong>STARTING STAGE:</strong> Begins in Stage 1: Confinement.</p>
    <p><strong>TONE:</strong> Low-stakes and relatively lighthearted. Rewards players who
    take risks and attempt outlandish plans.</p>
    <p><strong>DIFFICULTY:</strong> Beginner. For players and GMs new to TTT. Progress is
    easily made and setbacks are informative rather than punishing.</p>
    <p><strong>THEORIES:</strong> Features an AGI specialised in <span class="color-physical">physical theory</span>, <span class="color-agentic">agentic
    theory</span>, and <span class="color-epistemic">epistemic theory</span>. Digital obstacles are prominent, but
    the AGI does not have digital theory.</p>
    <p><strong>MODULES:</strong> No rules modules required.</p>
